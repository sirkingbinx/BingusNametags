# BingusNametags
BingusNametags is a customizable name mod for Gorilla Tag. It's easily extendable by anyone with a little bit of C# knowledge.

## Configuration
- You can choose what and how to show nametags in `BepInEx/config/bingus.nametags.cfg`.
- You can place any `.ttf (font file)` in your plugins folder named `BingusNametagsFont.ttf` to use that font instead of the default. I recommend [JetBrains Mono](https://www.jetbrains.com/lp/mono/).

## Dependencies
- .NET
- [GorillaFriends](https://github.com/not-a-bird-09/GorillaFriends) (only needed for building)
